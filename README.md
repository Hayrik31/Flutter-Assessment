# Flutter_assessment

This is the final result after a session of coding the screen provided in the assessment 
I have use a MVVM design pattern as you'll see in the code 
I used GetX for managing states and navigations(I had to code only one screen so there is no concrete navigation implementation but it's just hardcoded)
I created a file for each widget used so it makes the code well organized and scalable
Please note that i don't have access to the navigation bar icons so i improvised using something more or less similar
